Benvenuti!  My name is Jenifer and I am currently located in Austin, TX.  I have 15 years of Italian teaching experience and have worked with many different ages and levels of students, from beginner to advanced.
</p>

<p>
I tailor my classes to each student's individual needs and proficiency. We focus on conversation, pronunciation, vocabulary building, reading, writing, and grammar. I teach in private settings, or with small groups.
</p>

<p>
My teaching backround includes The Dante Alighieri Society in Cambridge, MA, the Boston School for Modern Languages, University of Texas, and numerous private students.
</p>

<p>
I lived in Italy for 3 years, and I have a BA in Italian Literature and Film from the University of Massachusetts in Amherst.
</p>

<p>For more information, please submit your name, email and / or phone number below and I will be in touch to answer any questions and to set up our first lesson.<p>

<h3 style="">From my students</h3>
<p>
"Jenifer is an excellent teacher. I have been taking Italian from her for a year and a half and could not be happier with my progress. Jenifer brings a very positive and enthusiastic attitude to her teaching and creates a relaxed and fun atmosphere during her lessons. I can't recommend her enough."  -- D.,  Austin, TX
</p>
<p>
"I had about six weeks to learn some basic conversational Italian before leaving Texas for Milano, and the audio books weren't working for me. What a treat to discover Jenifer, who not only equipped me with a solid foundation in grammar, everyday language essentials and some contemporary idioms, she did it without me even feeling like I was in class! We had some interesting and hilarious discussions--even with my preliminary Italian skills--and I began to really look forward to the lessons. My month in Italy was much easier as as result. Jenifer is an excellent teacher, and I was glad to be able to recommend her for a study abroad class the following year."   -- P.,  University of Texas, Austin.
</p>
<p>
"I teach a UT design course based in Milan and approached Jenifer to give my students some basic Italian language skills pre-departure &#8211; essentially to get them safely from the airport to the center of Milan and to order their first meal. She was excellent ... after an hour and a half a roomful of nervous 20-year olds on their first trip to Europe felt much more confident about their first steps in a new country. Jenifer was relaxed, dynamic, humorous and easily answered the myriad of questions we fired at her. She also agreed to give me (a linguistically challenged 40-year old) a crammer course to help me navigate visits to museums, design offices, public transportation, introductions and of course the grocery store. Our trip to Milan was a success and I survived very well using my newly acquired vocabulary. Thanks Jenifer + I&#8217;ll start earlier next year!"   --K., Professor of Design, UT, Austin, TX

<p>
"I called Jenifer for lessons a couple weeks before a trip to Italy.  I took only two classes and was amazed how much I was able to learn in that time.  It made my trip ten times more fun.   Make that eleven times more fun."   --Richard, Brooklyn, NY
